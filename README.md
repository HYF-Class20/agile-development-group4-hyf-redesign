# Hack Your Future redesign

Loruki is a website showcasing a fictional cloud hosting service with a sleek
and modern design.

## Description

This project aims to redesign the website for Hack Your Future, a 9-month web development program that takes place on Sundays in Brussels and Antwerp. The program is divided into 12 modules, with the last module being a 6-week intensive final project. The website currently has a modern design, but it could be improved to better serve the needs of the students and coaches.

The project will involve updating the website's layout, navigation, and content to make it more user-friendly and informative. The redesigned website should make it easy for prospective students to apply and for current students to access resources and support. It should also provide a clear overview of the program's curriculum and goals.

to inform visitors about the features of the program. Some of the main content elements of the website include:

- _Home Page_:The home page is the main landing page of the website and serves as an introduction to the program.

The redesign will aim to make it easier for potential volunteers to learn about the program and apply to become a coach/mentor, with clear instructions and contact information.

- _About page_: The about page provides the history of the program and the team behind it. The redesign will aim to make the content more engaging and informative, with a clear narrative that highlights the program's impact and evolution over time.

- _FAQ page_: The FAQ page contains frequently asked questions for applicants, volunteers, and partners. The redesign will aim to make the content more comprehensive and accessible, with clear categorization and visual aids that make it easy for users to find the information they need.

The redesign will aim to make it easier for supporters to donate and get involved, with clear instructions and call-to-action buttons that encourage engagement.
