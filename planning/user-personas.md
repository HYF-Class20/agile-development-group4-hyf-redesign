## **New immigrant**

**Name**: Zara

**Age**: 25

**Bio**: Zara is a recent immigrant to a new country, and although she has work
experience, she is struggling to find a job in her field due to language
barriers. She has always been interested in technology, and now sees this as an
opportunity to pursue a new career path. She heard about the Hack Your Future
program, a free coding class for refugees, women, and people with no background
in coding, and decided to apply.

**Needs/Goals**:

- To learn coding and programming skills to start a new career in technology
- To improve her language skills and communication abilities to better integrate
  into her new community
- To build a network of peers and mentors who can support her through the
  program and beyond
- To gain experience and confidence in the field of technology

**Frustrations**:

- Language barriers make it difficult for her to communicate and find work in
  her profession
- Lack of prior experience in coding and programming
- Financial constraints and limited access to resources for learning new skills
- Difficulty in finding community and support in a new country

**Scenario**: She decides to log onto the Hack Your Future website to see if
there are any resources or support available for students.

She navigates to the **_"Resources" page_** and finds a list of online tutorials
and videos that cover the same topics she's been learning in class. She clicks
on one of the videos and starts following along, pausing and rewinding as needed
to make sure she understands each step. As she works through the tutorial, she
starts to feel more confident in her coding abilities.

Next, she clicks over to the **_"Mentors" page_** and sees a list of volunteers
who are available to offer guidance and support to students. She sends an email
to one of the mentors, introducing herself and asking if they could meet to
discuss some of the challenges she's been facing in class. Within a few hours,
she receives a reply from the mentor, who is happy to set up a meeting.

Feeling more supported and connected to the Hack Your Future community, Zara
spends some time exploring the rest of the website. She reads through some of
the **_success stories_** from previous graduates and feels inspired by their
journeys. She also sees a link to a Slack channel for students and joins the
group, looking forward to chatting with her classmates and sharing tips and
resources.
