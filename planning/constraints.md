# Constraints

In order to maintain control and ensure the success of our project, we have
established several constraints that will guide our efforts. These constraints
are as follows:

## External

External constraints include factors outside of our team's control, such as
project deadlines, UI design or color schemes, and technologies used for website
development. We have established specific deadlines for each task and are
closely monitoring the design and technology aspects to ensure they align with
our objectives and meet the expectations of our target audience.

## Internal: Involuntary

Involuntary constraints include the amount of time available for each team
member to work on the project, which can impact the pace at which we can
complete tasks. To minimize the impact of these constraints, we will communicate
regularly and transparently about our availability and try to work
collaboratively to ensure the project stays on track.

## Internal: Voluntary

Voluntary constraints are those that we have established to manage our project
scope, such as coding style and conventions, a code review checklist, and hours
of work. By adhering to a specific coding style and conventions, we can ensure
consistency and make it easier for team members to understand each other's code.
The code review checklist will ensure that all code changes meet our quality
standards and align with our project objectives. Finally, setting boundaries on
the number of hours we work each week will ensure everyone is working
consistently and avoid overworking or burning out.
